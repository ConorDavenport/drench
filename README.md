# drench
The aim of this project is to write a program that can solve a game of
Drench. The game can be played [here](http://flashbynight.com/drench/),
and below is a picture of what it looks like.

## How to play
The aim of the game is to fill the board with a single colour. The board is
a 14x14 grid filled with a random selection of coloured squares. The
squares can be one of six colours; green, pink, purple, light cyan, red, and yellow.

The player starts as the top left tile and, with the six coloured buttons, 
they can change the colour of their tile.
